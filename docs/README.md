# Documentation

Note that scif-go is under development! Notes will be added to these pages as
functionality is available.

 - [usage](usage.md)
 - [development](development.md)
 - [development story](story.md)
 - [organization](organization.md)

I'll likely be adding (rendered) docs to here at some point.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Should I use GoLang or Python?

If you want an interactive experience (e.g., a Python shell with a client you
can inspect environments and interact directly with a scientific filesystem and/or
its functions, then you will be happier to use the [scif python](https://www.github.com/vsoch/scif)
base. If you want a ready to go binary and don't care about interaction, or want
to develop with GoLang, you're in the right spot.
