# SCI-F GoLang

This is the GoLang implementation of the Scientific Filesystem, and the first full GoLang package
that I'm developing. 

**under development**

## Development

### Commands

If you want to install dependencies (golint):

```bash
$ make deps
```

To build the package (the scif client goes into the [bin](bin) folder)

```bash
$ make build
```

To format all the files pretty:

```bash
$ make fmt
```
