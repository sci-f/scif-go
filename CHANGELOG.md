# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes
 - changed behaviour

## [master](https://github.com/sci-f/scif-go/tree/master)
 - first release candidate with all client functions, documentation, basic CI (0.0.1rc)
 - added --json option for inspect, saving labels to json file
